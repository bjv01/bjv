I am a PhD candidate at the [Center for Human-Inspired Artificial Intelligence (CHIA)](https://www.chia.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge, supervised by [Dr. Umang Bhatt](https://umangsbhatt.github.io) and co-supervised by [Prof. Anna Korhonen](https://sites.google.com/site/annakorhonen/). I am a member of [Wolfson College](https://www.wolfson.cam.ac.uk/). My work sits at the intersection of social science and technology, guided by the belief that AI should serve the best interests of humanity.

My research investigates the externalities of human-AI interaction: what happens when AI-assisted work flows to colleagues, patients, or decision-makers who weren't present. Current AI systems are optimizers with hidden costs: they enhance individual performance while the ripple effects go unmeasured. The downstream decisions shaped by AI-generated content, the trust dynamics altered, the expertise gradually displaced—these externalities determine whether AI truly serves organizations or merely appears to. I bridge AI, cognitive science, social science, and system design to make these hidden costs visible and ensure AI augments not just individual users, but the broader human networks they serve.

I hold an MSc in Data Science (with Distinction) from the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), where I developed a social data science metric for machine learning interpretability in collaboration with researchers from the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/). I received my BA in Sociology from [Pontificia Universidad Católica del Ecuador](https://www.puce.edu.ec/), where I served as President of the Student Federation (FEUCE) and later as General Secretary of the Federation of Private University Students of Ecuador (FEUPE).

I am Co-Founder and Editorial Coordinator of [Theorein. Revista de Ciencias Sociales](https://revistaacademica-sociales.puce.edu.ec/index.php/theorein), a peer-reviewed social science journal.
