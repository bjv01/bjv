PhD student at the [Center for Human-Inspired AI](https://www.chia.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Dr. Umang Bhatt](https://umangsbhatt.github.io) and [Prof. Anna Korhonen](https://sites.google.com/site/annakorhonen/).

I research the **externalities of human-AI interaction**—the ripple effects that occur when AI-assisted work flows to colleagues, patients, or decision-makers who weren't present. Current AI systems optimize for individual performance, but organizational effectiveness depends on what happens *after* the interaction. An AI that boosts your productivity while fragmenting your team's shared understanding is a local optimizer with hidden costs.

I build tools for empirical research on these externalities, designing trustworthy AI systems for teams and organizations—not just individual users.

## _current_projects

### Externalities of human-AI interaction
Investigating how sustained AI use influences individual and collective outcomes beyond immediate task performance. This includes studying changes in confidence calibration, skill development, and decision-making patterns when humans routinely collaborate with AI systems.

### Social evaluation of AI systems
Developing frameworks and metrics for assessing AI systems from a social science perspective, moving beyond purely technical evaluations to understand real-world impacts on users and communities.
