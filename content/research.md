PhD student at the [Center for Human-Inspired AI](https://www.chia.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, supervised by [Dr. Umang Bhatt](https://umangsbhatt.github.io) and [Prof. Anna Korhonen](https://sites.google.com/site/annakorhonen/).

Current AI systems optimize for individual performance, but effectiveness depends on what happens *after* the interaction: the downstream decisions shaped by AI-generated content, the trust dynamics altered, the expertise gradually displaced.

My research bridges AI, cognitive science, social science, and system design to ensure AI augments not just individual users, but the broader human networks they serve.

## _current_projects

### Externalities of human-AI interaction
Investigating how sustained AI use influences individual and collective outcomes beyond immediate task performance. This includes studying changes in confidence calibration, skill development, and decision-making patterns when humans routinely collaborate with AI systems.

### Social evaluation of AI systems
Developing frameworks and metrics for assessing AI systems from a social science perspective, moving beyond purely technical evaluations to understand real-world impacts on users and communities.
